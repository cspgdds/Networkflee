Prediction of refugee movements requires network maps. As, we have several locations, and identifying their connections, distances and constructing or visualising these links are time consuming. Hence, manually constructed network maps are proven to be inefficient at this moment. 

Automated network map construction allows to automate detect route connections and distances between locations. It requires a dataset (e.g. locations.csv) with location names and GPS coordinates in csv format.
